							<p>I am Jim Lombardi and the purpose of this website is to help me interact with other runners of all ages including those who are in their 60's, 70's and older. I started running regularly at the age of 16 in the Spring of 1959 and have run in at least one race every year since and hope to run for many years to come.  I have participated in approximately 830 races ranging from 440 yds to 50 miles and have covered approximately 87,000 miles in training and racing.  In the past 24 plus years I have run every day except for four. I think my experiences will help me help others enhance their enjoyment of running and improve their race times. The development of this website began on Feb. 1, 2016 and  the plan is to continually add information. Since 1962 I have kept a diary of my thoughts, discoveries, workouts, and race results. This diary will be helpful for the website's development. The things I do in training, preparing for races, and in competition work for me but they may not work for you.  But if there are some things you read here that seem like they may be helpful, give them a try.  Please feel free to tell me what you think.    </p>

										<h2 class="major">Training and Racing</h2> 
                    <p>My mileage averaged about 30 miles a week for my first 46 years of running. I never piled on the miles and maybe this is why most of my injuries were never very serious and I never really burnt out from running.  When I started training for ultramarathons 11 years ago, my average mileage increased to about 40 miles a week and I introduced some walking into my training sessions.  I have always included interval training on a regular basis. For me, I think running intervals compensates for the lack of high mileage. It also keeps me in shape for running shorter events. I like running and racing distances of any length up to 50 miles.  I also like running on tracks, treadmills, grass, and roads. Recently I have tried running on trails and I know I would like that too but I am not good at it.  Years of running on roads have ingrained a running form that causes me to not lift my feet very high off the ground.  On trails I trip a lot.  I used to mind running hills.  In the last 10 years or so I have been running a lot on hills and have grown to like hill running too.  I think all runners can benefit from coaches, talking to other runners and reading what other runners do. For many years I had a good friend at Allegheny College where I taught.  His name is Ralph White. Ralph is an excellent track and cross country coach. Ralph not only coached Allegheny teams but also started a community running club that was very active during the summer months.  I benefited a great deal from his coaching.  A key thing that he taught me is that a good training program includes 5 main components: long distance runs, tempo runs, interval training, hill training and rest or easy days.  It was under his direction that I learned about the use of weight machines for full body workouts. By 2002 when I was 60, Ralph had moved on to coaching at another college. For awhile I corresponded with him about my key workouts.  If you think you could benefit by reading my emails click below.  I have not included most of Ralph's emails to me but he always responded with good advice. </p>

                    <p> On October 24, 2004 at age 62 I ran the Casino Niagara Half-Marathon in 1:29:35 and was first among 17 runners in the 60-64 age group. The schedule of my key workouts for the year before that race is given in the 5 links below. On days not listed in the schedule I ran mainly on roads at an average pace.  Total miles for each week are also given.

                           <p>While following a training schedule similar to one outlined in the above links, your speed should be adjusted to match your present fitness level. </p> 
                    <h2> <a> <span style="background-color: red"><FONT COLOR="red">.....</FONT></span> </a> I love running just about any distance. </h2>
                            <p>In March 2010, I competed in the 800 meters, 1 mile, and 3000 meters at the National Indoor Masters Championship in Boston.  Later that year I ran the Canandaguia 50 mile run. I tremendously enjoyed all these races. I can remember the 3000 meters like it was yesterday. In this race Tom Jennings (the Tom Jennings from the Philadelphia area) and I pushed each other to probably the best times we could have run (about 11:30). Jennings out kicked me in the end but I really did't care. It was a great run for both of us.  You can watch a video of this race. You may find the whole race interesting but the race really starts after the 6 minute mark in the video. There are two races going on at the same time, one for the 60-64 age group and one for the 65-69 age group. Jennings (yellow shirt) and I (white shirt) are vying for first and second place in the 65-69 age group. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSnm3k7Tsw8"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT 
                    		style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Watch</FONT></font></a> the video. </p>
                    		<h2> <a> <span style="background-color: red"><FONT COLOR="red">.....</FONT></span> </a> Tempo Runs </h2>
                            <p>I mentioned that coach Ralph White introduced me to tempo runs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Dr. Jack Daniels</FONT></font></a> has determined that ideally tempo runs should last about 20 minutes and should be done at threshold pace.  He discusses tempo runs and threshold training in a 2005 Running Times article which is republished by Runner's World in an <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/threshold-training"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">on line article</FONT></font></a>.  In that article Daniels defines threshold pace and a quantity he calls VDOT. If a runner's VDOT is known, then the runner's threshold pace can be determined.  <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/workouts/threshold-training-finding-your-vdot"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Another Daniels article</FONT></font></a> has a table that relates VDOT to how fast a runner has raced. There are many racing distances included in the table ranging from 1500 meters to the marathon. You only need to have raced one of these distances to use the table to find your VDOT. There is another table in that second article that relates VDOT to the runner's threshold pace. These two tables are all you need to find out what your threshold pace should be for a tempo run.</p> 

                            <p> Let's consider an example. Open the link to the second Daniels article and scroll down to the two tables. From the first table, if your 10K race time is near 50:03 your VDOT is near 40. Remember, if you haven't raced a 10K, you can use some other race time. Now, from the second table a VDOT of 40 gives a threshold pace of 8:12/mi for a tempo run lasting 20 minutes. Paces for tempo runs for other lengths of time are also given in the second table. </p>

                            <p>I run tempo runs approximately once a week ranging from 20 minutes up to an hour.  Daniels recommends that tempo runs be on a relatively level surface so that the pace can be easily controlled. It is hilly in Meadville PA. So during the winter my tempo runs are usually on a treadmill and other months on an outdoor track. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Dealing with Injuries</h2>
										<p>During my years of running I have experienced many injuries and some of these have been reoccurring.  These include injuries to my hips, groin areas, hamstrings, Achilles tendons, arches, and the balls of my feet.  At times my right knee has had some discomfort and when I was young I had a few bouts with shin splints.  Recently I developed a shin splint in my left leg by running a long hilly course after not doing any hill running for awhile. Until I was in my late sixties I was mainly able to deal with injuries by stretching and cutting back on my speed and mileage.  Quite a few times when one of my Achilles tendons bothered me I would run with extra heel lifts.  The pain would eventually go away, I would take the lifts out of my shoes and I would be fine.  A few years ago injuries started to hang on longer and I needed a better way to deal with them.  Hopefully my recent approach to curing injuries with self-massage will be of interest to other runners.  </p>

										<h2> <a> <span style="background-color: red"><FONT COLOR="red">.....</FONT></span> </a> How I healed the ball of my foot</h2> 
                            <p> I think the way the ball of my right foot was healed could be very helpful to others. It does not involve cortisone shots but does involve massage and stretching. </p>
                            <p>I started effective massage of my sore left Achilles after visiting a therapist.  To find out more about this you should click the "MORE" link above.  I also tried massaging the sore ball of my right foot. It did not respond until I also started stretching it in a certain way.  To stretch the bottom of my right foot, I put the tips of my fingers of both my hands under the toes of this foot and my thumbs on the tops of the two toes next to my big toe.  The thumbs are positioned where the knuckles of the two toes stick up a little.  Holding my toes in this way, I pull them upward and back in the direction of my leg thereby stretching the muscles in the ball of my foot.  I hold the stretch for about 30 seconds and then I rest and repeat once. I started stretching my foot in this way when it was very sore. I did it every day and the ball of my foot got better and better.  After a month my foot was considerably better. After two months I was able to run with no discomfort. I still stretch and massage both balls of my feet almost every day as a protective measure. </p>

								<h2 class="major">The Joy of Running</h2>
									<p>I enjoy running with other runners. In 2002 I ran the Baltimore Marathon with my daughter Laura.  She had never run any races before, trained for 6 months prior to the event, and raised money for an AIDS clinic in Washinton DC.  In 2011 I ran the Philadelphia Marathon with Denyse Hannon. It was her first marathon.  The first photo below was taken a few hundred yards from the finish and you can see the big smile on Denyse's face.  That's me with the blue shirt.  In 2012 I ran the Drake Well Marathon with another "first-timer", Olivia Hemlock.  It was great to be with Laura, Denyse and Olivia at the end of their first marathons to experience their joy.  Memories of them will be with me forever. There is nothing quite like running with a first-timer and I recommend it to all runners. </p>
										<p> Jim Fitch introduced me to ultramarathoning in 2005. Among other things, he told me about the Mohican 100 Mile Trail Run and mentioned pacers. In many ultras, a runner is allowed to have a pacer who runs or walks with the runner during some portion of the second half of the run. Later in 2005 I paced Jim in the Mohican 100. That same year I ran the JFK 50 Miler. In 2012 I paced Jim for 30 miles of the Pine Creek Challenge 100 Mile Run.  The second photo below is at the 95 mile mark. Ultra runners and their pacers often become good friends if they aren't already. This is another of the many joys of running. </p>

									<p>In 1963 I met <a href="http://www.georgesheehan.com/"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">George Sheehan</FONT></font></a> at one of my first road races. It was in Plainfield NJ.  We both had just joined the Central Jersey Track Club. Over the next 5 years we competed in many of the same events and traveled together for some of them. For a number of years he bought me subscriptions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Ross"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Browning Ross's</FONT></font></a> publication the <a href="http://www.rrcahistory.org/longdistancelog.html"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Long Distance Log</FONT></font></a>. I believe it is the second running magazine. In 1965 George, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ayres"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Ed Ayres</FONT></font></a> and I made up the Central Jersey TC team that won the Cherry Tree Marathon in Central Park against teams from the NY metropolitan area. Ed is known now as the founding editor of Running Times magazine and author. George is known now as a running philosopher and author. I knew him as easy to talk to, a tough competitor and a good friend.  In 1971 I moved away from New Jersey and only met George a few times at races after that.  One time was in 1983 at the Dublin Marathon. Another time was at a Hamot 10K in Erie PA a few years before George died.  Both times George was a guest speaker. In 1982 we met by chance at a race in Southern New Jersey. The photo below was taken after that race. The newspaper article seen below appeared in George's newspaper, the Red Bank Area's Daily Register the Monday after the 1965 Cherry Tree Marathon.  It reports the Central Jersey TC team results. </p>

										<p>  Many times when traveling I look for a race to run. It's fun to meet runners I would otherwise not meet and run on new courses.  Our daughter Laura lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  She and her husband Joe O'Brien have two girls Maureen and Oona. Mary Jane and I visit them twice a year and often stay about a month each time.  They live in the southern part of Amsterdam near Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam's Woods). This beautiful area is miles wide and long and has many paths and trails for running. It's a great place and many runners take advantage of it. I have run quite a few races in the Amsterdam area.  One time Joe and I ran a race that we thought was a 10K.  Actually the race was 10 miles and somehow this important bit of information was lost in translation.  You can imagine our dismay when after pacing for a 10K we got to the 10K mark and found we had 4 miles left. Years later we still laugh about it. The Amsterdam Marathon is a big thing and many spectators come out to cheer along the way.  The finish is on the Olympic Stadium track where Olympic events were held in 1928.  Joe and I ran the marathon in 2011 and we did that side by side the whole way. We had a great run. The photo on the left below is of Joe and me after the Amsterdam Marathon. In 2014 we ran  together in the

Most ultramarathoners don't like small loops, but I don't mind them at all. It was nice to have Mary Jane, Laura, Maureen and Oona see us after each mile. A very friendly group organized and directed the run. By the middle of the six hours the lap counters were kidding with Joe and me and cheering us on.  The group also made friends with our family. At the award ceremony they asked Maureen to hand out the flower awards to the age group winners.  The photo on the right below shows Maureen happily awarding flowers.  </p>

It has a great deal of information concerning ultramarathoning around the world. It even ranks yearly ultra results for open and age group runners from around the world. </p>

									<p>Mary Jane  and I have two children, Jamie and Laura.  As mentioned above Laura and her family live in Amsterdam. Jamie, his wife Sheryl and their two girls Lynnea and Abby live in Meadville PA, the same town as Mary Jane and I.  Jamie was a very good runner in high school and college but gave up running after he graduated from college in 1993. In 2015 he started to run again and ran in a few races with his daughter Abby and me.  The photo on the left below of Abby and Jamie was taken at the finish of the Human Race in Meadville on Memorial Day 2015.  I think the lighting is interesting. Also notice how both runners have both feet off the ground at the moment the photo is taken. Photo by Mary Jane Lombardi.</p>
