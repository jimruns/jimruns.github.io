							<p>I am Jim Lombardi and the purpose of this website is to help me interact with other runners of all ages including those who are in their 60's, 70's and older.  I enjoy training for and running races over a wide range of distances. Last year I ran two marathons and this year I ran the Green Jewel 50K and the Canandaigua 50 mile run on my 76th birthday, October 13th.
              One way that runners can effectively interact is to inform each other concerning their training and racing.  If you read the following three links I think you will get a good picture of how I train and race.

              <h2>My recent training and racing log as I prepare for the Canandaigua 50 Mile Run on October 13, 2018 is <a href="JimLombardiTrainingandRacingLog.pdf"target="_blank"> <font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"><bold>here</bold></FONT></font>. The log starts on July 21, 2018. Other training and racing logs can be found below.</h2>

              <h2>The backbone of a long distance training schedule is the number and quality of the long runs completed in training and racing. From February 2017 through October 2018 I completed 31 training runs and races of 10 miles or more.  The average distance for these is 16.3 miles. Click <a href="LongRuns2017_2018.pdf"target="_blank"> <font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"><bold>here</bold></FONT></font> to view a list of these runs including details on pace and in some cases information on nourishment.</h2>

              <h2>I started running regularly at the age of 16 in the Spring of 1959 and have run in at least one race every year since and hope to run for many years to come. I think a key to being able to run for a long time is not to run an excessive number of miles and at the same time to train consistently.  I also know that running intervals is very important and I have included interval training throughout my running career.  For me I feel that interval training can make up for not running many miles in training.  In 2018 I continue to run intervals with many of these workouts being with a running group of about 10 runners. To view these workouts click <a href="ThurIntervalTraining2018.pdf"target="_blank"> <font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"><bold>here</bold></FONT></font>. </h2>  

               The development of this website began on Feb. 1, 2016 and  the plan is to continually add information. I think my experiences will help me help others enhance their enjoyment of running and improve their race times. I have participated in approximately 850 races ranging from 440 yds to 54 miles and have covered approximately 90,000 miles in training and racing.  During a 23 year period ending in 2015 I ran every day. Since then I have been usually skipping about one day a week and sometimes even more when I am tapering for a race.  Since 1962 I have kept a diary of my thoughts, discoveries, workouts, and race results. This diary will be helpful for the website's development. Things I do in training, preparing for races, and in competition work for me but they may not work for you.  But if there are some things you read here that seem like they may be helpful, give them a try.  Please tell me what you think.

                                            <h3 class="major">"Charity Miles" is a free app that allows you to earn money for a charity by running, walking or biking. You can choose from a large list of charities.  Your charity gets 25 cents/mile when you walk or run and 10 cents/mile when you bike.  The app uses your phone's GPS outdoors and its motion detectors indoors. If you run 20 miles a week you could earn $260 in a year for you favorite charity. You can change from one charity to another any time.  My charity is "Feeding America" and I really feel good that I am doing this.

							<h2> <a><FONT COLOR="yellow"> An overview of my training and racing </FONT></a></h2>
                            <p>My mileage has averaged about 30 miles a week during my 60 years of running. I never piled on the miles and maybe this is why I have had only a few serious injuries and I never really burnt out from running. As I mentioned before I have always included interval training on a regular basis in part because I think running intervals helps me run long distances without running a very large number of miles in training. But running intervals also keeps me in shape for running short races. I like running and racing distances of any length up to 50 miles.  I also like running on tracks, treadmills, grass, and roads. When I started training for ultramarathons in 2005, I introduced some walking into my training sessions. Recently I have tried running on trails and I know I would like that too but I am not good at it.  Years of running on roads have ingrained a running form that causes me to not lift my feet very high off the ground.  On trails I trip a lot.  I used to mind running hills.  Since 2005 I have been running a lot on hills and have grown to like hill running too.  I think all runners can benefit from coaches, talking to other runners and reading what other runners do. For many years I had a good friend at Allegheny College where I taught.  His name is Ralph White. Ralph is an excellent track and cross country coach. Ralph not only coached Allegheny teams but also started a community running club that was very active during the summer months.  I benefited a great deal from his coaching.  A key thing that he taught me is that a good training program includes 5 main components: long distance runs, tempo runs, interval training, hill training and rest or easy days.  It was under his direction that I learned about the use of weight machines for full body workouts.

                            <h2> <a><FONT COLOR="yellow"> I love racing just about any distance. </FONT></a></h2>
                            <p>In March 2010, I competed in the 800 meters, 1 mile, and 3000 meters at the National Indoor Masters Championship in Boston.  Later that year I ran the Canandaguia 50 mile run. I tremendously enjoyed all these races. I can remember the 3000 meters like it was yesterday. In this race Tom Jennings (the Tom Jennings from the Philadelphia area) and I pushed each other to probably the best times we could have run (about 11:30). Jennings out kicked me in the end but I really did't care. It was a great run for both of us.  You can watch a video of this race. You may find the whole race interesting but the race really starts after the 6 minute mark in the video. There are two races going on at the same time, one for the 60-64 age group and one for the 65-69 age group. Jennings (yellow shirt) and I (white shirt) are vying for first and second place in the 65-69 age group. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSnm3k7Tsw8"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I mentioned that coach Ralph White introduced me to tempo runs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Dr. Jack Daniels</FONT></font></a> has determined that ideally tempo runs should last about 20 minutes and should be done at threshold pace.  He discusses tempo runs and threshold training in a 2005 Running Times article which is republished by Runner's World in an <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/threshold-training"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">online article</FONT></font></a>.  In that article Daniels defines threshold pace and a quantity he calls VDOT. If a runner's VDOT is known, then the runner's threshold pace can be determined.  <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/workouts/threshold-training-finding-your-vdot"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Another Daniels article</FONT></font></a> has a table that relates VDOT to how fast a runner has raced. There are many racing distances included in the table ranging from 1500 meters to the marathon. You only need to have raced one of these distances to use the table to find your VDOT. There is another table in that second article that relates VDOT to the runner's threshold pace. These two tables are all you need to find out what your threshold pace should be for a tempo run.</p>

                            <p> Let's consider an example. Open the link to the second Daniels article and scroll down to the two tables. From the first table, if your 10K race time is near 50:03 your VDOT is near 40. Remember, if you haven't raced a 10K, you can use some other race time. Now, from the second table a VDOT of 40 gives a threshold pace of 8:12/mi for a tempo run lasting 20 minutes. Paces for tempo runs for other lengths of time are also given in the second table. </p>

                            <p>I run tempo runs approximately once a week ranging from 20 minutes up to an hour.  Daniels recommends that tempo runs be on a relatively level surface so that the pace can be easily controlled. It is hilly in Meadville PA. So during the winter my tempo runs are usually on a treadmill and other months on an outdoor track. </p>

                                        <p>During my years of running I have experienced many injuries and some of these have been reoccurring.  These include injuries to my hips, groin areas, hamstrings, Achilles tendons, arches, and the balls of my feet.  At times my right knee has had some discomfort and when I was young I had a few bouts with shin splints.  Recently I developed a shin splint in my left leg by running a long hilly course after not doing any hill running for awhile. Until I was in my late sixties I was mainly able to deal with injuries by stretching and cutting back on my speed and mileage.  Quite a few times when one of my Achilles tendons bothered me I would run with extra heel lifts.  The pain would eventually go away, I would take the lifts out of my shoes and I would be fine.  A few years ago injuries started to hang on longer and I needed a better way to deal with them.  Hopefully my recent approach to curing injuries with self-massage will be of interest to other runners.  </p>

                            <p> I think the way the ball of my right foot was healed could be very helpful to others. It does not involve cortisone shots but does involve massage and stretching. </p>
                            <p>I started effective massage of my sore left Achilles after visiting a therapist.  To find out more about this you should click the "MORE" link above.  I also tried massaging the sore ball of my right foot. It did not respond until I also started stretching it in a certain way.  To stretch the bottom of my right foot, I put the tips of my fingers of both my hands under the toes of this foot and my thumbs on the tops of the two toes next to my big toe.  The thumbs are positioned where the knuckles of the two toes stick up a little.  Holding my toes in this way, I pull them upward and back in the direction of my leg thereby stretching the muscles in the ball of my foot.  I hold the stretch for about 30 seconds and then I rest and repeat once. I started stretching my foot in this way when it was very sore. I did it every day and the ball of my foot got better and better.  After a month my foot was considerably better. After two months I was able to run with no discomfort. I still stretch and massage both balls of my feet almost every day as a protective measure. </p>

                            <p>Between 2014 and 2016 when I was running around the Allegheny College athletic fields, quite often I saw Walt Peterson running and walking with his dog Rocky.  In the beginning we would just say hi and maybe talk a little.  I began to wonder why I saw him so often.  Then in May of 2016 we got to talking quite a bit.  I found the answer to my question.  He is running and walking 8 miles a day at age 73.  But that is not the most intriguing and amazing thing about Walt.  His story is one of determination and it shows what we can do to make our bodies healthier and our lives happier.  I asked Walt to write about his journey so he could share it with others who may find it helpful.  Walt's story is

                            <p>Approximately 20 years ago in my early 50's,  I was diagnosed with glaucoma.  Under the care of my ophthalmologist, the effects of glaucoma have been kept in check with the use of various eye drops.  A few years ago my doctor suggested that I try a drop that contained a beta blocker.  He warned that fatigue is a reported side effect and possibly could affect my running.  I decided to try the drops and found that they noticably affected my performance if I tried to run fast.  My doctor immediately prescribed a non-beta blocker alternative.  I realize that some runners may have conditions that make it necessary to use beta blockers.  But I suggest in any case that you tell your doctor you are a runner.  Also sometimes drug interactions can cause beta blockers to have an extra strong effect on your running and you should ask about this too.  Phil Krajewski's story is an excellent example of what could happen to a runner who does not know that some eye drops could contain a beta blocker. Phil's story is

                                    <p>I enjoy running with other runners. In 2002 I ran the Baltimore Marathon with my daughter Laura.  She had never run any races before, trained for 6 months prior to the event, and raised money for an AIDS clinic in Washinton DC.  In 2011 I ran the Philadelphia Marathon with Denyse Hannon. It was her first marathon.  The first photo below was taken a few hundred yards from the finish and you can see the big smile on Denyse's face.  That's me with the blue shirt.  In 2012 I ran the Drake Well Marathon with another "first-timer", Olivia Hemlock.  It was great to be with Laura, Denyse and Olivia at the end of their first marathons to experience their joy.  Memories of them will be with me forever. There is nothing quite like running with a first-timer and I recommend it to all runners. </p>
                                        <p> Jim Fitch introduced me to ultramarathoning in 2005. Among other things, he told me about the Mohican 100 Mile Trail Run and mentioned pacers. In many ultras, a runner is allowed to have a pacer who runs or walks with the runner during some portion of the second half of the run. Later in 2005 I paced Jim in the Mohican 100. That same year I ran the JFK 50 Miler. In 2012 I paced Jim for 30 miles of the Pine Creek Challenge 100 Mile Run.  The second photo below is at the 95 mile mark. Ultra runners and their pacers often become good friends if they aren't already. This is another of the many joys of running. </p>

                                    <p>In 1963 I met <a href="http://www.georgesheehan.com/"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">George Sheehan</FONT></font></a> at one of my first road races. It was in Plainfield NJ.  We both had just joined the Central Jersey Track Club. Over the next 5 years we competed in many of the same events and traveled together for some of them. For a number of years he bought me subscriptions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Ross"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Browning Ross's</FONT></font></a> publication the <a href="http://www.rrcahistory.org/longdistancelog.html"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Long Distance Log</FONT></font></a>. I believe it is the second running magazine. In 1965 George, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ayres"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Ed Ayres</FONT></font></a> and I made up the Central Jersey TC team that won the Cherry Tree Marathon in Central Park against teams from the NY metropolitan area. Ed is known now as the founding editor of Running Times magazine and author. George is known now as a running philosopher and author. I knew him as easy to talk to, a tough competitor and a good friend.  In 1972 I moved away from New Jersey and only met George a few times at races after that.  One time was in 1983 at the Dublin Marathon. Another time was at a Hamot 10K in Erie PA a few years before George died.  Both times George was a guest speaker. In 1982 we met by chance at a race in Southern New Jersey. The photo below was taken after that race. The newspaper article seen below appeared in George's newspaper, the Red Bank Area's Daily Register the Monday after the 1965 Cherry Tree Marathon.  It reports the Central Jersey TC team results. </p>

                                        <p>  Many times when traveling I look for a race to run. It's fun to meet runners I would otherwise not meet and run on new courses.  Our daughter Laura lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  She and her husband Joe O'Brien have two girls Maureen and Oona. Mary Jane and I visit them twice a year and often stay about a month each time.  They live in the southern part of Amsterdam near Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam's Woods). This beautiful area is miles wide and long and has many paths and trails for running. It's a great place and many runners take advantage of it. I have run quite a few races in the Amsterdam area.  One time Joe and I ran a race that we thought was a 10K.  Actually the race was 10 miles and somehow this important bit of information was lost in translation.  You can imagine our dismay when after pacing for a 10K we got to the 10K mark and found we had 4 miles left. Years later we still laugh about it. The Amsterdam Marathon is a big thing and many spectators come out to cheer along the way.  The finish is on the Olympic Stadium track where Olympic events were held in 1928.  Joe and I ran the marathon in 2011 and we did that side by side the whole way. We had a great run. The first photo below is of Joe and me after the Amsterdam Marathon.

Most ultramarathoners don't like small loops, but I don't mind them at all. It was nice to have Mary Jane, Laura, Maureen and Oona see us after each mile. A very friendly group organized and directed the run. By the middle of the six hours the lap counters were kidding with Joe and me and cheering us on.  The group also made friends with our family. At the award ceremony they asked Maureen to hand out the flower awards to the age group winners.  The second photo below shows Maureen happily awarding flowers.  </p>
                                        <p>When searching for information concerning ultramarathon running in The Netherlands, I found this wonderful <a  href="http://statistik.d-u-v.org/"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">link</FONT></font></a>.  It has a great deal of information concerning ultramarathoning around the world. It even ranks yearly ultra results for open and age group runners from around the world. </p>

                                    <p>A great thing about running early in the morning is you get to see things you wouldn't normally see. The first photo below is the scene we were treated to during registration for the Trail Blazer 15K on the Ernst Trail in Meadville PA. Notice the Sun shining through the fog.  By the time the race started the Sun had burned off the fog and the sky was blue.  Photo by Mary Jane Lombardi. </p>
                                    <p>Mary Jane  and I have two children, Jamie and Laura.  As mentioned above Laura and her family live in Amsterdam. Jamie, his wife Sheryl and their two girls Lynnea and Abby live in Meadville PA, the same town as Mary Jane and I.  The second photo below of Abby and Jamie was taken at the finish of the Human Race in Meadville on Memorial Day 2015.  I think the lighting is interesting. Also notice how both runners have both feet off the ground at the moment the photo is taken. Photo by Mary Jane Lombardi.</p>

Mary Jane and I have stayed a few times in an apartment with a window that faces the windmill seen in the background. As a matter of fact we were staying there at the time Maureen our grandchild was born. The night before she was born Maureen's four grandparents had dinner in the "Windmill View Apartment." It was just by chance that the photo was taken as we were passing the windmill.  Photo by John Collins of Amsterdam.</p>

You can choose from a large list of charities.  Your charity gets 25 cents/mile when you walk or run and 10 cents/mile when you bike.  The app uses your phone's GPS outdoors and its motion detectors indoors. If you run 20 miles a week you could earn $260 in a year for you favorite charity. You can change from one charity to another any time.  My charity is "Feeding America" and I really feel good that I am doing this.
