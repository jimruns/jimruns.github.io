							<h2>Welcome to Jim Runs!</h2>
							<p>I am Jim Lombardi and the purpose of this website is to help me interact with other runners of all ages including those who are in their 60's, 70's and beyond.  I started running regularly at the age of 16 in the Spring of 1959 and have run in at least one race during every year since and hope to continue running and racing for many years to come.  I have participated in approximately 830 races ranging from 440 yds to 50 miles and have covered approximately 87,000 miles in training and racing.  In the past 24 plus years I have run every day except for four. I think my experiences will help me help others enhance their enjoyment of running. The development of this website began on Feb. 1, 2016 and  the plan is to continually add information. Since 1962 I have kept a diary of my thoughts, discoveries, workouts, and race results. This diary will be helpful for the website's development. </p>

										<h4 class="major">Various Aspects of Training: Coaches and Friends Help A Lot</h4> 
                    <p>My mileage averaged about 30 miles a week for my first 46 years of running. I never piled on the miles and maybe this is why most of my injuries were never very serious and I never really burnt out from running.  When I started training for ultramarathons 11 years ago, my average mileage increased to about 40 miles a week and I introduced some walking into my training sessions.  I have always included interval training on a regular basis. For me, I think running intervals compensates for the lack of high mileage. It also keeps me in shape for running shorter events. I like running and racing distances of any length up to 50 miles.  I also like running on tracks, treadmills, grass, and roads. Recently I have tried running on trails and I know I would like that too but I am not good at it.  Years of running on roads have ingrained a running form that has me not lifting my feet very high off the ground.  On trails I trip a lot.  I used to mind running hills.  In the last 10 years or so I have been running a lot on hills and have grown to like hill running too.  I think all runners can benefit from coaches, talking to other runners and reading what other runners do. For many years I had a good friend at Allegheny College where I taught.  His name is Ralph White. Ralph is an excellent track and cross country coach. Ralph not only coached Allegheny teams but also started a community running club that was very active during the summer months.  I benefited a great deal from his coaching.  A key thing that he taught me is that a good training program includes 5 main aspects: long distance runs, tempo runs, interval training, hill training and rest or easy days.  It was under his direction that I learned about the use of weight machines for full body workouts. By 2002 when I was 60, Ralph had moved on to coaching at another college. For a while I corresponded with him by email telling him my key workouts.  If you think you could benefit by reading my emails click below.  I have not included most of Ralph's emails to me but he always responded with good advice. </p>

                    <p> On October 24, 2004 at age 62 I ran the Casino Niagara Half-Marathon in 1:29:35 and was first among 17 runners in the 60-64 age group. If you would like to see the schedule of my key workouts for the year before that race, click the 5 links below. On days not listed in the schedule I ran mainly on roads at an average pace.  Total miles for each week are also given.

										<h2 class="major">Dealing with Injuries, February 10, 2016</h2>
										<p>During my years of running I have experienced many injuries and some of these have been reoccurring.  These include injuries to my hips, groin areas, hamstrings, Achilles tendons, arches, and balls of feet.  At times my right knee has had some discomfort and when I was young I had a few bouts with shin splints.  Recently I developed a shin splint in my left leg by running a long hilly course after not doing any hill running for awhile. Until I was in my late sixties I was mainly able to deal with injuries by stretching and cutting back on my speed and mileage.  Quite a few times when one of my Achilles tendons bothered me I would run with extra heel lifts.  The pain would eventually go away, I would take the lifts out of my shoes and I would be fine.  A few years ago injuries started to hang on longer and I needed a better way to deal with them.  Hopefully my recent approach to curing injuries with self-massage will be of interest to other runners.  </p>
										<p>Within a few weeks this website will include links to two youtube videos that show how I massage my
                                        tendons, calves and lower legs and how I stretch and massage my feet. Further in the future I will
                                        include links to other videos that show how I massage other parts of my body. </p>

                            <p> Jim Fitch introduced me to ultramarathoning in 2005 when he told me about the Mohican 100 Mile Trail Run and I paced him during the Mohican run.  Later that year I ran the JFK 50 Miler. In 2012 I paced Jim during the Pine Creek Challenge 100 Mile Run.  The photo to the left is at the 95 mile mark. <p>

										<h2 class="major">The Joy of Running</h2>
										<p>I enjoy running with other runners. In 2002 I ran the Baltimore Marathon with my daughter Laura.  She had never run any races before, trained for 6 months prior to the event, and raised money for an AIDS clinic in Washinton DC.  In 2011 I ran the Philadelphia Marathon with Denyse Hannon. It was her first marathon.  The photo to the left was taken a few hundred yards from the finish and you can see the big smile on Denyse's face.  That's me with the blue shirt.  In 2012 I ran the Drake Well Marathon with another "first-timer", Olivia Hemlock.  It was great to be with Laura, Denyse and Olivia at the end of their first marathons to experience their joy.  Memories of them will be with me forever. There is nothing quite like running with a first-timer and I recommend it to all runners. </p>

									<p>In 1963 I met George Sheehan at my first road race. It was in Plainfield NJ.  We both had just joined the Central Jersey Track Club. Over the next 5 years we competed in many of the same events and traveled together for some of them. For a number of years he bought me subscriptions to Browning Ross's Long Distance Log.  I believe it is the first running magazine. In 1965 George, Ed Ayres and I made up the Central Jersey TC team that won the Cherry Tree Marathon in Central Park against teams from the NY metropolitan area. Ed is known as the founder and editor for Running Times magazine and author of running books. George is known now as a running philosopher and writer. I knew him as easy to talk to, a tough competitor and a good friend.  In 1971 I moved away from New Jersey and only met George a few times at races after that.  One time was in 1983 at the Dublin Marathon. Another time was in ??? at the Hamot 10K in Erie PA not too long before George died.  Both times George was a guest speaker. In 1982 we met by chance at a race in Southern New Jersey. The photo below was taken after that race. The newspaper article seen below appeared in George's newspaper, the Red Bank Area's Daily Register the Monday after the 1965 Cherry Tree Marathon.  It reports the Central Jersey TC team results. </p>

										<p>  Many times when traveling I look for a race to run. It's fun to meet runners I would otherwise not meet and run on new courses.  Our daughter Laura lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  She and her husband Joe O'Brien have two girls Maureen and Oona. Mary Jane and I visit them twice a year and often stay about a month each time.  They live in the southern part of Amsterdam near Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam's Woods). This beautiful area is miles wide and long and has many paths and trails for running. It's a great place and many runners take advantage of it. I have run quite a few races in the Amsterdam area.  One time Joe and I ran a race that we thought was a 10K.  Actually the race was 10 miles and somehow this important bit of information was lost in translation.  You can imagine our dismay when after pacing for a 10K we got to the 10K mark and found we had 4 miles left. Years later we still laugh about it. The Amsterdam Marathon is a big thing and many spectators come out to cheer along the way.  The finish is on the Olympic Stadium track where Olympic events were held in ????.  Joe and I ran the marathon in 2011 and we did that side by side the whole way. We had a great run. The photo on the left below is of Joe and me after the Amsterdam Marathon. In 2014 we ran  together in the 
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Chinmoy/register.aspx?did=34562"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">Sri Chinmoy Self-Transendence 6 hour Run</FONT></font></a> on a mile loop. Most ultramarathoners don't like small loops, but I don't mind them at all. It was nice to have Mary Jane, Laura, Maureen and Oona see us after each mile. A very friendly group organized and directed the run. By the middle of the six hours the lap counters were kidding with Joe and me and cheering us on.  The group also made friends with our family. At the award ceremony they asked Maureen to hand out the flower awards to the age group winners.  The photo on the right below shows Maureen happily awarding flowers.  </p>
										<p>When searching for information concerning ultramarathon running in The Netherlands, I found this wonderful <a  href="http://statistik.d-u-v.org/index.php?Language=EN"target="_blank"><font color="blue"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow">link</FONT></font></a>.  It has a great deal of information concerning ultramarathoning around the world. It even ranks yearly ultra results for open and age group runners from around the world. </p>

									<p>Mary Jane and I have two children, Jamie and Laura.  As mentioned above Laura and her family live in Amsterdam. Jamie, his wife Sheryl and their two girls Lynnea and Abby live in Meadville PA, the same town as Mary Jane and I.  Jamie was a very good runner in high school and college but gave up running after he graduated from college in 1993. In 2015 he started to run again and ran in a few races with his daughter Abby and me.  The photo below of Abby and Jamie was taken at the finish of the Human Race in Meadville on Memorial Day 2015.  I think the lighting is interesting. Also notice how both runners have both feet off the ground at the moment the photo is taken. </p>
