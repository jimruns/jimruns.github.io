							<h2>Welcome to Jim Runs!</h2>
							<p>I am Jim Lombardi and the purpose of this website is to help me interact with other runners.  I started running regularly at the age of 16 in the Spring of 1959 and have run in at least one race during every year since and hope to continue running and racing for many years to come.  I have participated in approximately 830 races ranging from 440 yds to 50 miles and have covered approximately 87,000 miles in training and racing.  In the past 24 plus years I have run every day except for four. I think my experiences will help me help others enhance their enjoyment of running and hope to interact with runners of all ages. I have a special interest in those who continue running in their 60's, 70's, and beyond.  The development of this website began on Feb. 1, 2016 and  the plan is to continually add information. Since 1962 I have kept a diary of my thoughts, discoveries, workouts, and race results.  This diary will be helpful for the website's development. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Dealing with Injuries, February 10, 2016</h2>
										<p>During my years of running I have experienced many injuries and some of these have been reoccurring.  These include injuries to my hips, groin areas, hamstrings, Achilles tendons, arches, and balls of feet.  At times my right knee has had some discomfort and when I was young I had a few bouts with shin splints.  Recently I developed a shin splint in my left leg by running a long hilly course after not doing any hill running for awhile. Until I was in my late sixties I was mainly able to deal with injuries by stretching and cutting back on my speed and mileage.  Quite a few times when one of my Achilles tendons bothered me I would run with extra heel lifts.  The pain would eventually go away, I would take the lifts out of my shoes and I would be fine.  A few years ago injuries started to hang on longer and I needed a better way to deal with them.  Hopefully my recent approach to curing injuries with self-massage will be of interest to other runners.  </p>

                            <p> Jim Fitch introduced me to ultramarathoning in 2005 when he told me about the Mohican 100 Mile Trail Run and I paced him during the Mohican run.  Later that year I ran the JFK 50 Miler. In 2012 I paced Jim during the Pine Creek Challenge 100 Mile Run.  The photo to the right is at the 95 mile mark. <p>

										<h2 class="major">The Joy of Running</h2>
										<p>I enjoy running with other runners.  In 2011 I ran with Denyse Hannon in the Philadelphia Marathon.  It was her first marathon.  This photo was taken a few hundred yards from the finish.  You can see the big smile on her face.  That's me with the blue shirt.  It was great to be with Denyse at the end and to experience her joy.  I will never forget it.  In 2012 I ran a marathon with another "first timer", Olivia Hemlock.  There is nothing quite like it.  I recommend it to all runners. </p>

									<p>In 1963 I met George Sheehan at my first road race. It was in Plainfield NJ.  We both had just joined the Central Jersey Track Club. Over the next 5 years we competed in many of the same events and traveled together for some of them.  We became good friends.  For a number of years he bought me subscriptions to Browning Ross's Long Distance Log.  I believe it is the first running magazine. In 1965 George, Ed Ayres and I made up the Central Jersey TC team that won the Cherry Tree Marathon in Central Park against teams from the NY metropolitan area. George is well known now as a running philosopher and writer. Ed is known as the founder and editor for Running Times magazine and author of running books. In 1971 I moved away from New Jersey and only met George a few times at races after that.  One time was in 1983 at the Dublin Marathon. Another time was in ??? at the Hamot 10K in Erie PA not too long before George died.  Both times George was a guest speaker. In 1982 we met by chance at a race in Southern New Jersey. The photo below was taken after that race. The newspaper article seen below appeared in George's newspaper, the Red Bank Area's Daily Register the Monday after the 1965 Cherry Tree Marathon.  It reports the Central Jersey TC team results.
