I think the way the ball of my right foot was healed could be very helpful to others. It does not
involve cortisone shots but does involve massage and stretching.

I started effective massage of my sore left Achilles after visiting a therapist. To find out more about
this you should click the "MORE" link above. I also tried massaging the sore ball of my right foot.
It did not respond until I also started stretching it in a certain way. To stretch the bottom of my
right foot, I put the tips of my fingers of both my hands under the toes of this foot and my thumbs
on the tops of the two toes next to my big toe. The thumbs are positioned where the knuckles of the
two toes stick up a little. Holding my toes in this way, I pull them upward and back in the direction
of my leg thereby stretching the muscles in the ball of my foot. I hold the stretch for about 30
seconds and then I rest and repeat once. I started stretching my foot in this way when it was very
sore. I did it every day and the ball of my foot got better and better. After a month my foot was
considerably better. After two months I was able to run with no discomfort. I still stretch and massage
both balls of my feet almost every day as a protective measure.
