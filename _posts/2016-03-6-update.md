In one of my old posts, [Something Interesting Happened](2016-02-21-interesting) I talked about something
interesting that happened to me during a workout.

It's Sunday March 6, 2016. Two weeks ago I did a 20 mile training run and the next day I did the
walk/run workout described above with good results. Yesterday I completed the Green Jewel 50K and
today I repeated the walk/run workout with similar results as 2 weeks ago. It will be interesting
to find out how I will feel tomorrow.

It's Monday March 7, 2017. Two days ago I completed the Green Jewel 50K. Yesterday I repeated the
walk/run workout described above. Both yesterday and today I did self-massage of both legs and hips.
This is the first time I have massaged and did my walk/run workout the day after an ultra. I am
usually stiff 2 days after an ultra. Today my legs feel a little tired but I am not stiff. I just had
a 3 mile workout on roads and my last mile was in 8:43.
