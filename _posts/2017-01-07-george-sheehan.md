In 1963 I met [George Sheehan](http://www.georgesheehan.com/) at one of my first road races. It was
in Plainfield, NJ. We both had just joined the Central Jersey Track Club. Over the next 5 years we
competed in many of the same events and traveled together for some of them. For a number of years he
bought me subscriptions to [Browning Ross's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Ross) publication
the [Long Distance Log](http://www.rrcahistory.org/longdistancelog.html). I believe it is the second
running magazine. In 1965 George, [Ed Ayres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ayres) and I made up
the Central Jersey TC team that won the Cherry Tree Marathon in Central Park against teams from the
NY metropolitan area. Ed is known now as the founding editor of Running Times magazine and author.
George is known now as a running philosopher and author. I knew him as easy to talk to, a tough
competitor and a good friend. In 1972 I moved away from New Jersey and only met George a few times at
races after that. One time was in 1983 at the Dublin Marathon. Another time was at a Hamot 10K in
Erie, PA a few years before George died. Both times George was a guest speaker. In 1982 we met by
chance at a race in Southern New Jersey. The photo below was taken after that race. The newspaper
article seen below appeared in George's newspaper, the Red Bank Area's Daily Register the Monday after
the 1965 Cherry Tree Marathon. It reports the Central Jersey TC team results.
