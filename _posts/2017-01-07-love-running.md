In March 2010, I competed in the 800 meters, 1 mile, and 3000 meters at the National Indoor Masters
Championship in Boston. Later that year I ran the Canandaguia 50 mile run. I tremendously enjoyed all
these races. I can remember the 3000 meters like it was yesterday. In this race Tom Jennings (the
Tom Jennings from the Philadelphia area) and I pushed each other to probably the best times we could
have run (about 11:30). Jennings out kicked me in the end but I really did't care. It was a great
run for both of us. You can watch a video of this race. You may find the whole race interesting but
the race really starts after the 6 minute mark in the video. There are two races going on at the same
time, one for the 60-64 age group and one for the 65-69 age group. Jennings (yellow shirt) and I
(white shirt) are vying for first and second place in the 65-69 age group. Watch the video below.
