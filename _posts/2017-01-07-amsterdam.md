 Many times when traveling I look for a race to run. It's fun to meet runners I would otherwise not
 meet and run on new courses. Our daughter Laura lives in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. She and her
 husband Joe O'Brien have two girls Maureen and Oona. Mary Jane and I visit them twice a year and
 often stay about a month each time. They live in the southern part of Amsterdam near Amsterdamse
 Bos (Amsterdam's Woods). This beautiful area is miles wide and long and has many paths and trails
 for running. It's a great place and many runners take advantage of it. I have run quite a few races
 in the Amsterdam area. One time Joe and I ran a race that we thought was a 10K. Actually the race
 was 10 miles and somehow this important bit of information was lost in translation. You can imagine
 our dismay when after pacing for a 10K we got to the 10K mark and found we had 4 miles left. Years
 later we still laugh about it. The Amsterdam Marathon is a big thing and many spectators come out
 to cheer along the way. The finish is on the Olympic Stadium track where Olympic events were held
 in 1928. Joe and I ran the marathon in 2011 and we did that side by side the whole way. We had a
 great run. The photo on the left below is of Joe and me after the Amsterdam Marathon. In 2014 we
 ran together in the [Sri Chinmoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Chinmoy) Self-Transendence
 6 hour Run on a mile loop. Most ultramarathoners  don't like small loops, but I don't mind them at
 all. It was nice to have Mary Jane, Laura, Maureen and Oona see us after each mile. A very friendly
 group organized and directed the run. By the middle of the six hours the lap counters were kidding
 with Joe and me and cheering us on. The group also made friends with our family. At the award ceremony
 they asked Maureen to hand out the flower awards to the age group winners. The photo on the right
 below shows Maureen happily awarding flowers.

 When searching for information concerning ultramarathon running in The Netherlands, I found this
 wonderful [link](http://statistik.d-u-v.org/). It has a great deal of information concerning
 ultramarathoning around the world. It even ranks yearly ultra results for open and age group runners
 from around the world.
