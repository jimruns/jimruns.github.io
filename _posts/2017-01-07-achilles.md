Sample text talking about what you were doing when you injured your achilles tendon. Then tell the story
about how you went to one doctor and they advised rubbing it lightly and then in Amsterdam you went
to another doctor and they said to rub it hard. Below is a video that I recorded demonstrating how
I was able to relieve myself of pain in my achilles tendon.

Maybe talk about the video more down here.

Also, if you would like to learn more about dealing with injuries, check out one of my other posts
discussing my injuries and how I overcame them. This post [here](2017-01-07-ball-of-foot) talks about
how I injured the ball of my foot. To read about more generally some of the injuries that I have experienced
in my many years of running, check out [this post](2017-01-07-injuries).
