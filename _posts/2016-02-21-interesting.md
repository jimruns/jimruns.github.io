It's Sunday February 21, 2016 and something interesting happened with my running today. Yesterday I
ran a 20 miler in preparation for a 50K in a few weeks. It was a good run and today when I went out
to run I felt somewhat stiff and tired. I decided to try something I had never tried the day after
a long run. I set my GPS to beep every 0.25 miles. I walked the first 0.25, when the GPS beeped I ran
until it beeped again. I kept doing this alternating running and walking every 0.25 miles. In the
beginning I didn't have energy and incentive to walk or run very fast. I thought I would just cover
3 miles. As the workout went on I felt better and better. By 3 miles I was feeling really good so
I kept going. In the beginning I was walking at a pace near 15:40/mi and running at 11:32/mi. By the
4th mile I was walking near 13:30/mi and running near 9:00/mi so I went on for a total of 5 miles. As
I write this 4 hours later I still feel pretty good. I am not too stiff. I wonder how I will feel
tomorrow. Maybe I found a good workout for the day after a long run. It's now Monday February 22, 2016.
I ran only 2 miles today on a slightly hilly road course. I am usually stiff 2 days after a long run
but I wasn't stiff at all just a little tired. Average pace 8:27/mi. I am going to try yesterday's
workout again after my next long run.
