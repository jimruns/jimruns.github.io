Between 2014 and 2016 when I was running around the Allegheny College athletic fields, quite often
I saw Walt Peterson running and walking with his dog Rocky. In the beginning we would just say hi
and maybe talk a little. I began to wonder why I saw him so often. Then in May of 2016 we got to
talking quite a bit. I found the answer to my question. He is running and walking 8 miles a day at
age 73. But that is not the most intriguing and amazing thing about Walt. His story is one of
determination and it shows what we can do to make our bodies healthier and our lives happier. I asked
Walt to write about his journey so he could share it with others who may find it helpful. Walt's story
is below.

## Road to a Healthy Life
### By Walt Peterson

When I retired in 2007 I was 64 years old.  Six months later I was diagnosed with colon cancer and
had 12 inches taken out of my colon. It was stage 1. My doctor told me to lose weight and exercise.
I started lifting weights and walking and running with my dog Rocky. Now, nine years later I am walking
and running 4 miles in the AM and 4 miles in the PM. Rocky used to go out with me twice a day. Now,
he is with me just in the morning. He is trim and doing well for being 20 years old. Running and
walking all these years has kept him fit. When I started working out, I was 5'7" tall and weighed
214 pounds. My blood pressure was 160/98 and I had borderline high cholesterol. I slowly built up
the miles that I walked and ran each day and lost approximately 2 pounds every month. Five years after
I started working out up until now my blood pressure has remained near 102/62, and my weight near 123
pounds. To maintain my good health I eat small portions, very little snacks and sugar, and healthy
food. The keys to these changes are will power and a healthy lifestyle. I have been cancer free for
nine years, and my dog Rocky is still walking with me at 20 years old.
